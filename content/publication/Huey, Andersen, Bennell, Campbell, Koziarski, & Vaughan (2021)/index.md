abstract: In the wake of several high-profile cases involving deaths in police custody of persons with mental illness (PMIs), there has been significant public interest in police reform in this area. Much of this interest, and the resulting demands for change, is couched in the language of public health. Mental illness is seen as a health condition in which social determinants – that is, those economic, cultural, environmental, institutional, and other factors that can influence health outcomes – can function as supports or barriers to well-being. In this language, the metaphor of a stream or river is invoked in order to visualize where appropriate responses to mental health conditions should lie. ‘Upstream’ solutions are those programs, practices, policies, or other innovations that address factors which are limiting or preventing individual and community access to healthcare treatment. An example of an ‘upstream’ initiative might be a community-based outreach program aimed at moving mentally ill, homeless citizens into secure housing and treatment. Such approaches are contrasted with ‘downstream’ initiatives, which often entail programs or practices to respond to individuals who, lacking healthcare access and/or other necessary supports, are now in immediate crisis. As decades of research has shown, one of the single biggest examples of ‘downstream’ responses to individuals dealing with significant mental health issues is the use of public policing (Bittner 1967 1990; Lamb et a. 2002; Patch and Arrigo 1999; Schulenberg 2016; Teplin 1984; Wells and Schaffer 2006). To a dizzying extent, policing has in many instances become the defacto response to mental health issues (see also Wood, Watson, and Fulambarker 2017). The origins of this report, and of the Royal Society of Canada’s Mental Health and Policing Working Group, can be traced to the unique situation Canadians have faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unique circumstances of this global outbreak, which have, for many Canadians, resulted in serious illness and death, intensified economic uncertainties, altered family and lifestyle dynamics, and generated or exacerbated feelings of loneliness and social dislocation, rightly led the Royal Society of Canada’s COVID-19 Taskforce to consider the strains and other negative impacts on individual, group, and community mental health. With the central role that police too often play in the lives of individuals in mental and/or emotional crisis, we were tasked with exploring what can be reasonably said about the state of our current knowledge of police responses to PMIs. In response to our charge, the Mental Health and Policing Working Group set out to assessthe myriad ways in which police work results in encounters involving PMIs. The result was a working paper that documented the complex nature of these interactions. In this second volume, we move away from the dynamics leading to police encounters towards an exploration of some of the existing suite of ‘downstream’ policing programs and initiatives in use in Canada. In the pages that follow, we present an assessment of the current evidence base for each selected, with a particular focus on reviewing experimental, evaluative, and other research conducted in Canada. Our intention is to provide policymakers and practitioners with a better-informed understanding of the strengths and limitations of the current evidence base for programs that have already been widely adopted. In this paper, we explore the knowledge base in the following areas: mental health screening tools, situation tables/hub models, non-escalation and de-escalation training, and crisis intervention and co-response models. In each section, we provide a brief overview of the intervention, program, and/or tool. Then we move on to reviewing the evidence base for each, including presenting a discussion of what the relevant literature reveals in terms of the relative strengths and weaknesses of a given response model or tool. From there, we provide a succinct snapshot of what is both known about a model, as well as areas in which future research is critically needed. Finally, based on an analysis of the data and research gathered, we present a series of recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.
