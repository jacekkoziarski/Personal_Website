I am a PhD Candidate in the Sociology Department at the [**University of Western Ontario**](https://sociology.uwo.ca/), Managing Editor of [**Police Practice & Research**](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=gppr20), a Research Associate for the [**Canadian Society of Evidence-Based Policing**](https://www.can-sebp.net/), and a Research Fellow with the [**Saskatoon Police Service**](https://saskatoonpolice.ca/). My research centers on various aspects of policing, with a particular focus on police interactions with persons with perceived mental illness (PwPMI). Another line of inquiry for my work centers around examining the spatial and temporal patterns of both crime and non-crime-related issues (e.g., police-PwPMI interactions, missing persons, etc.). Some of my most recent research appears in *Policing & Society*, *Policing: A Journal of Policy and Practice*, and *Crime Science*.
